    Running form plays a crucial role in performance, efficiency, and injury prevention.
    This tool helps analyze key aspects of running form and provides recommendations for improvement.

    While a comprehensive form analysis ideally includes video assessment by a coach or professional,
    this tool can help identify potential areas for improvement.

    **Scientific Validation**: The metrics and recommendations provided are based on research in biomechanics and running economy.

                **How to address multiple form issues:**

                1. **Prioritize** - Focus on one primary form change at a time
                2. **Integration** - Begin with short form-focused segments (5-10 minutes)
                3. **Progression** - Gradually extend duration of form focus
                4. **Feedback** - Use video, mirrors, or coaching for regular assessment
                5. **Consistency** - Practice new movement patterns regularly

                **Timeline expectations:**
                - Initial awareness: 1-2 weeks
                - Conscious competence: 2-4 weeks
                - Unconscious integration: 4-8+ weeks

                **Remember**: Form changes require patience and consistent practice!
