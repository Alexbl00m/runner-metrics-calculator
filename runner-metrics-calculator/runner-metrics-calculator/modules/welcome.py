            **Getting Started with Running Metrics**:

            1. **Focus on consistency over intensity**
               - Regular easy runs are the foundation of improvement
               - Aim for 3-4 runs per week before adding speed work

            2. **Use heart rate as your primary intensity guide**
               - Learn your zones using the Heart Rate Reserve calculator
               - Keep most runs in Zone 1-2 (easy/conversational pace)

            3. **Progression guidelines**
               - Increase weekly volume by no more than 10% per week
               - Add one "quality" session per week after building a base
               - Include rest days between harder efforts

            4. **Key metrics to track**
               - Resting heart rate (sign of improving fitness when it decreases)
               - Easy pace (should gradually get faster at the same heart rate)
               - Distance of longest run (build gradually)

            **Block Periodization**
            - Concentrated blocks focusing on specific abilities
            - Example: 3-week blocks alternating between:
              - Threshold/tempo focus
              - VO2max/interval focus
              - Specific endurance/race pace focus
            - Monitor with Training Load calculator to prevent overtraining

            **Advanced Recovery Protocols**
            - Implement HRV-guided training decisions
            - Utilize strategic nutrition timing
            - Incorporate altitude or heat training when appropriate
            - Monitor sleep quality metrics
